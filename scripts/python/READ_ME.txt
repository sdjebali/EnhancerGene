# Python scripts:
# - 'merge_intervals.py': create a consensus interval for each line. Used  for
#the connected component.
# - 'ID_to_intervals.py': I used ID to create the connected components, this
#script give back the intervals corresponding to the ID.
# - 'lists_for_Venn.py': separate the connected component file in lists used to
#draw the Venn diagramm.
# - 'normalisation_DNase.py': normalise the file containing count of chromatin
#opening by the size of the library.
# - 'normalisation_sizeandsum_DNase.py': normalise the file containing count of
#chromatin opening by the size of the library (sum of all counts) and the size
#of the interval.
# - 'connected_components.py': connected component algorithm, create groups.
# - 'coverage_fichierA.py': helps study the coverage of connected component.
# - 'fichier_arretes_cHiC.py': give links between two cHi-C interactions to
#merge.

# All the scripts used to calculate the correlation are put in the corresponding
